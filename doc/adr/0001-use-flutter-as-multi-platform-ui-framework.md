# 1. Use Flutter as multi-platform UI framework

## Context

The mobile app should feel like native for users on different platforms.
I know JavaScript/TypeScript but have little experience with React and React Native.
I have little experience with Flutter and Dart and would like to learn more.

## Decision

Use Flutter with Dart, as it's cross-platform, offers an extensive UI library and provides good performance.

## Consequences

Little knowledge of Dart would be a limiting factor /as it happened before/.
